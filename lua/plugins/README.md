Plugins
-------

- `./ui` has plugins related to my preferred look and feel for neovim; all are loaded.
- `./base` has functional plugins that markedly enhance neovim's functionality; all are loaded.
- `./lang` has plugins for language support; language-specific loading.
- `./etc` has plugins I'm testing; the ones I like are loaded explicitly in `./init.lua`.
- `./configs` has plugin configurations; only loaded if corresponding plugin is loaded.
- `../mappings` has plugin and universal mappings; only loaded if corresponding plugin is loaded.
